# Didlake-Resource-Center
This is the Didlake Research Group (DRG) official code repository at Penn State. The purpose of this repository is to provide a common platform for sharing and collaborating on code related to tropical meteorology research. 

# How to use
INDEX.md contains an itemized list of all the tools available in this repository organized by the type of operation each file accomplishes. 

# Issues - The goal of this repository
We aim to produce a feature-complete resource for meteorology and atmospheric science researchers, particularly tropical meteorology. However, accomplishing this task is impossible without input from you (the users). Thus, if you believe a feature is missing, create an issue describing what you believe is missing.
